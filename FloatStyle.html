  </strong> is a 3,000-foot (910 m) vertical rock formation in Yosemite Nationa Park, located on the north side of Yosemite Valley,
  near its western end. The granite monolith is one of the world's favorite challenges for rock climbers. The formation was named
  "El Captain" by the Mariposa Battalion when it explored the valley in 1851.</p>
   <p><img scr="Cobblestone.png" alt="Cobblestone" width="100" height="80" style="float:right; padding: 12px;"/><strong> Tunnel View</strong>
   is a viewpoint on State Route 41 located directly east of the Wawona Tunnel as one enters Yosemite Valley from the south. The view looks 
   east into Yosemite Valley including the southwest face of El Captain, Half Dome, and Bridalveil Falls. This is, to many, the first view of 
   the popular attractions in Yosemite.</p>
