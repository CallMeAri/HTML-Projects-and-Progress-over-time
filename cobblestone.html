    <p><strong>Cobblestone</strong> is a common block, obtained from mining stone. It is mainly used for crafting or as a building block.Cobblestone required a pickaxe to be mined, in which case it drops itself. If mined without a pickaxe, it drops stone.
    Its hardness is greater than stone so it requires more time to break, especially with anything other than a pickaxe.</p>

    <p><strong>A Pickaxe is one of the most commonly used tools in the game, being required to mine all ores, rock, rock-based blocks and metal-based blocks, depending on the material it is made from.
    Specific pickaxe materials are also required to harvest certain types of blocks</p>
